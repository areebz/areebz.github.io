"#Software Engineering?" 

Today, technology is an essential skill and software companies are in demand for engineers. A career in software engineering will help me understand not just why products are made but also how they are made.
As I lost my job due to covid in May I wanted a change. I knew I wasn't going to be happy in sales my whole life. I was always interested in the backend of products made by companies. I always wanted to learn coding but I didnâ€™t think I could do it. With self doubt I always pushed it aside and focused on pursuing the sales route I was currently on. As quaretntine hit, I thought this would be the best time to step out of my norm and work towards a career that excites and challenges me.

Its definitely one of the scariest decisions I have made. I had a little background in HTML and CSS from what I taught myself. I began watching videos and talking to a few people and they recommended a coding bootcamp. Already week 1 I was frustrated and questioning if I could do this. As I went through each lab I felt an accomplishment and I knew I was getting closer to my goal. I know in 10 months, all my hardwork will finally pay off as I accept a job as a software developer.

I graduated with a Bachelors in Psychology and I now work in a tech company where I truly see myself growing. I love learning and challenging myself. Math was one of my favorite subject because I liked solving problems and feeling that satisfaction of solving a problem. My goal is to keep pushing myself with new challenges. As hard as this year will be, I know it'll be worth it. I am excited to start my journey at flatiron.
